In this case study, you'll use MySQL, PHPMyAdmin, Juptyer Notebook, and SQLite to tackle a series of challenges on a database containing information about a country club. For this case study, you'll see what a database looks like on a nice interface like PHPMyAdmin, and connect to a local instance of the database using Python and SQLite. 

In this case study I answered 13 questions using SQL for the Country Club database. You can find the questions and answers [here](https://github.com/GHASS19/SQL-Country-Club-Data/blob/main/Report/SQL%20Country%20Club%20Questions%20%26%20Answers.pdf). I also learned how to use SQL queries in python.
